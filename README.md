# ROMULUS-H in Java

Lightweight module for data encryption and decryption using lightweight encryption algorithm ROMULUS-H. This is Java adaptation of [ROMULUS-H C implementation](https://github.com/romulusae/romulus).

# About The Project

Romulus is a submission to the NIST Lightweight Cryptography competition, with three authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) schemes and a hash function, all based on a tweakable block cipher (TBC) Skinny. More precisely, Romulus-H is a variant of the popular double-block hashing scheme based on block cipher proposed by Hirose at FSE 2006 and a domain extension scheme by Hirose et al. at Asiacrypt 2007. Romulus-H comes with a strong security guarantee, namely (n âˆ’ log2 (n))-bit indifferentiability using an n-bit-block primitive.
